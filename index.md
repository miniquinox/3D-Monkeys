All our NFTs consist of two parts: GIF (video), and GLB (animated 3D model). Both of these are animated and ready to import into the Metaverse!

3D Monkeys can be treated as "rigged stocks". The price of every unsold NFT in the collection will be raised by an automation algorith **every three days** by **0.1 WETH**, raising the floor price of the collection every time. There has never been a better time to HODL (Hold On for Dear Life). By holding your 3D monkey for 30 days, you add 1 WETH to your value!!  
  
Here is a simple example: Buy your favorite 3D monkey for 1 WETH (current floor price). Wait 60 days, and the floor price of the collection is now 3 WETH. Sell it a bit lower than the floor to ensure people will buy it from you rather than directly from the collection. List it for 2.8 WETH and you will sell it in no time, as it just became the lowest in the collection!! We encourage everyone to buy 3D monkeys from people who sell lower than the floor price of the collection since this keeps a steady flow of trade.

The collection is listed at a starting price of 0.2 WETH, and the first price raise will happen on May 16th, 2022. Buy as many as you would like. The more you own and the earlier you get them, the bigger the profit!

We have a surprise for everyone who owns 3 or more monkeys as of May 16th, 2023. Join our Discord to stay in touch with our community. It is the easiest way to find monkeys lower than the floor price. Once a month, 10 random monkeys will change their price back to 0.2 WETH for 24h and only members of Discord will have accesss to buying these. Imagine buying a 5 WETH monkey for 0.2 WETH???
